# hackathon
This is a project called MemoreX
It goes through all of your files and builds a tree graph.
It uses search results based on your information to form associations [maybe mind mapping or uses classification like those described in objective rule order]  that you might be interested about.
It uses NuPIC to look for patterns in your data and that elsewhere.
Basically, we are trying to mimic how your brain forms associations.
