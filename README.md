This is a project called MemoreX, a pun on Vannevar Bush’s CIA project.
It goes through all of your files and builds a tree graph.   I have been thinking about this since looking at Ben Goertzel’s OpenCog project.
It uses search results based on your information to form associations [maybe mind mapping or uses classification like those described in Affordance Competition Hypothesis]  that you might be interested about.  
It uses NuPIC to look for patterns in your data and patterns in external data elsewhere.
Basically, we are trying to mimic how your brain forms associations.
