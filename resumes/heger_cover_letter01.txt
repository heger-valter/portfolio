Dear Sir/Madame:
I am currently seeking employment as a Software Engineer. I have fifteen years of software development experience on a variety of applications, platforms, and languages. I am looking to continue working using my Java, COM/OLE, Internet, and e-commerce experience. I worked at IBM on electromagnetic modeling in the BlueGene group.
I had the opportunity to be involved in the entire spectrum of a project from beginning to end. I have presented ideas in initial design review meetings, created flow charts, drew state diagrams, provided detailed documentation, wrote pseudo-code which was reviewed during group review, wrote executable code which was also peer-reviewed, wrote batch test code to demonstrate the functionality of various subroutines, helped isolate and debug code during integration testing, and helped verify customer sell-off.
Sincerely,
Walter Heger
